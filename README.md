# The world's worst dotfiles!

Luke's dotfiles, he doesn't update them often.

I recently started using [Hyper](https://hyper.is) on my machines. It's an electron-based terminal emulator. It sounds scary, and yes, it does use more resources than iTerm2, but not nearly as much as other electron projects (about 80MB of ram with several tabs). That said.. it's sheer beauty is enough to be worth such a small sacrifice.
