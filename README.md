# my: dotfiles

Daily, I use a Windows 10 (yes, Microsoft) machine as I'm a full time student and sometimes using Linux (*on the desktop*) is a small but noticeable inconvenience. Nevertheless, I feel like it's important to have a centralized place to keep my configs (namely Ansible) for when I do server work, which is nearly every day. For authenticity though, these dotfiles have been written on a F23 machine w/vim using the [Ultimate vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc). 

## Credits:
*The following helped me in some way*:

* [Xe/dotfiles](https://github.com/Xe/dotfiles) - inspiring dotfiles, that's for sure.. her playbooks are very nice, I used those as a guide for building mine (since I'm an ansible novice, and too lazy to read the whole docs).

*During my time using Fedora, I began to love Gnome 3, a DE I have seriously despised in the past, Fedora has done a simply great job making this distro extremely polished, even for a rolling-release.*
